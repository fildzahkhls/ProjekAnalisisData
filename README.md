# Bike Rentals ðŸš²
This project is the final project of the coding data analysis class. In this project I created 4 questions and answered them with visualization and used 2 datasets, namely hour and day. I also carried out 2 advanced analysis techniques, namely RFM and clustering analysis. Lastly, I also made a dashboard using streamlit.

### File Structures
- /dashboard: This directory contains the dataset used (here I use day and hour) and also contains the python files used to create the dashboard
- /data: this directory contains the dataset in this project, in this case hour and day in .csv format
- notebook.ipynb: File used for data analysis
- README.md: This file contains markdown files regarding explanations, requirements for creating projects, and how to run the dashboard.
- requirements.txt: This file contains the library used in the data analysis process
- url.txt: This file contains a link to the results of uploading the streamlit dashboard to the cloud

### Setup Environment
```sh
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install streamlit
```
then clone this repository with your local computer
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fildzahkhls/ProjekAnalisisData
```
### Run ipynb File
- Download this project.
- Open your IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but here I use Jupyter Notebook).
- Create a New Notebook.
- Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
- Lastly, run all the code cells.

### Run Streamlit
- Open your code editor
- Open the file in ur project directory. Go to the dashboard directory and open the file with the .py extension
- Open the terminal
- Navigate to the directory where the python files are stored, in this case the dashboard directory
- Then type "streamlit run dashboard.py"
